# Burp Suite
An intercepting proxy used to analyze and exploit web applications.

Prefrom 
- content discovery
- Fuzzing
- Password attacks
- Injection attacks
- Vulnerability scans

# Nikto
Vulnerability scanner that can be used to identify known web server vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, identify web applications running on a server, and identify potential known vulnerabilities in those web applications. 

Perform
- Discover the type of HTTP server
- Web application running on host
- expose vulnerabilities

Arachni
An open-source web scanner application is available with a booth command line and web-based graphical interfaces. Araachni categorizes the severity of potential issues as high, medium, low, or informational. Arachni provides a detailed description of each vulnerability, the location in the web app where the vulnerability was exploited, what input was used to exploit it, and what document object model (DOM) element was exploited. 

Tests Vulnerabilities
- Code injection
- SQL injection
-  XSS
- CSRF
- local remote file inclusion
- session fixation, directory traversal
- backdoors,
- insecure policies
- server information
- leakage
- personal data exposure

# ScoutSuite
An open-source security auditing tool is used to assess cloud infrastructure security. It allows organizations to evaluate the security of their cloud environments across multiple providers and services, 

Collects data from a cloud platform using API calls. Then, it compiles a report of all the discovered objects, including VM instances, storage containers, and IAM, with severity levels based on predetermined policies.


# Prowler
It is an audit tool used for AWS. It can detect configuration errors and security issues, such as weak passwords, upgraded systems, and insecure protocol use. It can also be used to evaluate cloud infrastructure against the CIS benchmarks.

# Pacu
An exploitation framework for evaluating the security of an AWS environment. It includes modules for exploiting APIs and VM instances. An attacker or pen tester can use cloud-access credentials to determine how they may be abused to gather information about other account and configured services or gain unauthorized access to cloud services.
