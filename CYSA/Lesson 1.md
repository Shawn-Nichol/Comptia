Risk Avoidance: In risk mitigation, the practice of ceasing an activity that presents a risk. 

Risk Acceptance: The response of determining that risk is within the organization's appetite and that no countermeasures other than ongoing monitoring are needed. 

Risk Mitigation: The response of reducing risk to fit within an organization's willingness to accept risk. 

Risk Transfer: In risk meditation, the response of moving or sharing the responsibility of risk with another entity, such as by purchasing cybersecurity insurance. 

Threat Modeling: The process of identifying and assessing the possible threat actors and attack vectors that pose a risk to the security of an app, network, or other system. 

# Security Controls
Technical: A category of security control that is implemented as a system. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls.

Operational: the control is implemented primarily by people rather than systems. 

Managerial: The control oversees the information system. 

# Security Control Functional Types
Preventative: A security control that acts before an incident to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed. 

Detective: A type of security control that acts during an incident to identify or record that it is happening. 

Corrective: A type of security control that acts after an incident to eliminate or minimize its impact. 

Compensating: A security measure that takes on risk mitigation when a primary control fails or cannot completely meet expectations. 

Responsive: A type of security control that serves to direct corrective actions after an incident has been confirmed. 

# Attack surfaces
Passive discovery: Such as network packet capture, can reveal information about network-connected hosts' communication channels, protocols in use, and activity patterns. 

Edge discovery: Any device connected to the Internet

# Methods to reduce the attack surface
- Asset Inventory
- Access Control
- Patching Updating
- Network segmentation
- Removing unnecessary components
- Employee training

# Patch Management consideration
- Individual task-specific team responsible for reviewing
- Mechanism to patch operating systems and all applications running on them.
- Assign updates into urgent, important, and noncritical categories.
- Test environment where urgent and important patches can be installed and tested.
- Detailed logging to support monitoring and troubleshooting of patch deployment activities
- Immediate push for critical systems
- A routine schedule for the rollout of noncritical patches.

Change Management: Process through which information system configuration changes are implemented as part of the organization's overall configuration management efforts. 

# Summary
- Policies are produced by government teams and dictate how work tasks are performed.
- Risk management is a specialized discipline that advises governance teams.
- Attack surfaces are complicated and require continuous management and monitoring
- Patch and configuration management play a significant role in protecting endpoints.
